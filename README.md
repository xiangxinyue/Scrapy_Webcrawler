# Project Name: simple_scrapy by Xinyue Xiang 
# Requirement
python&scrapy frame 
# Prepare the Environment
Download the scrapy frame. 
I use the Mac OS and I found it hard to use "$ pip install Scrapy command" in my Macbook terminal. So I use the virtualenv to install Scrapy. I posted the install terminal lines in the "install the Scrapy".
# Create and Start Project
Create my new Scrapy project in the Scrapy. We need to find the location of our Scrapy installed and create our project in that folder.
$ scrapy startproject XXX (I used the mySpider in this README)
# Instruction of Documents
1. mySpider/spiders (directions of spiders code)
2. scrapy.cfg & mySpider/settings.py (project configuration information and files)
3. mySpider/items.py (sets the data store template for structured data)

5. mySpider/ (Python module for a project that references code from here)
